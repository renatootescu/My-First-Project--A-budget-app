# My First Project: A budget app

This is my very first project.

It is a simple app that lets you track your budget comparing Planned amounts vs Actual amounts.

The user enters the data in forms generated with the Python Flask module, rendered in HTML and saved in a SQALchemy database 
The data can ve and can be seen/updated/deleted in 2 tables.
Also, the data is visualized on the front page through SVG graphs generate with the PYGAL Pythin module:

The application also supports user registering, reseting user password, updating user account
