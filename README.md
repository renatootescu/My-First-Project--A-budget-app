# My First Project: A budget app

This is my very first project.

It is a simple app that lets you track your budget comparing Planned amounts vs Actual amounts.

The user enters the data in forms generated with the Python Flask module, rendered in HTML and saved in a SQALchemy database 
The data can be seen/updated/deleted in 2 tables and it is visualized on the front page through SVG graphs generated with the PYGAL Python module:

The application also supports user registering, reseting user password, updating user account. 

The back-end is built in Python 3.6.5, with Flask 1.0.2 module, Pygal module, SQLAlchemy module and a few other smaller modules.

Note: to run the application you will need to set up environment varialbles. See config.py for more details
